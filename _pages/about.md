I am a third-year PhD student at [Laboratoire d'Informatique de Modélisation et d'Optimisation des Systèmes](https://limos.fr/), Université Clermont Auvergne, Clémont Ferrand, France. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Viet Hung Nguyen](https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=P163).

My PhD project is about the application of Machine Learning to Combinatorial Optimisation. In a nutshell, many combinatorial problems can be modelised as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and solved by Branch-and-Bound or Branch-and-Cut methods. At each node of the decision tree of these methods, one needs to make many decisions: which variables to branch? which cut to apply? Our idea is to use Machine Learning to learn the optimal strategy for these decisions to get accelerate the solvers
